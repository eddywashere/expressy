## Express.js starter app

This recipe includes jade, coffee & stylus on the clientside.

Install dependencies

	npm install

Start app with

    npm start
    
If you like coffee, compile it with

    npm run-script brew
    
Notes:

- still not sure about coffeescript, but its there
    - I wish there was an awesome connect middleware equivalent to stylus for coffeescript
        - actually, I wish there was a solid asset manager like sprockets :[

Todo:

- add db config, models and odm thingy
- add some css patterns from other projects
- make this a solid starting point for future projects!
