## Expressy

Just another express mvc boilerplate. I built this to learn and explore app development with express. Checkout the [demo](http://expressy.ewh.jit.su/).

This recipe includes jade templating with coffee & stylus for the clientside. Build's upon the basic app but *will have a bit more organization and features.

Install dependencies

	npm install

Start app with

    npm start
    
If you like coffee, compile it with

    npm run-script brew
    
Notes:

- still not sure about coffeescript, but its there
    - I wish there was an awesome connect middleware equivalent to stylus for coffeescript
        - actually, I wish there was a solid asset manager like sprockets :[

Todo:

- add db config, models and odm thingy
- add some css patterns from other projects
- make this a solid starting point for future projects!
