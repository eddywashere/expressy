# Expressy

Just another express mvc boilerplate. I built this to learn and explore app development with express.

This recipe includes jade templating with stylus. Build's upon the default express app but *will have a bit more organization and features. Uses mongodb via mongoose.

## Instructions

Install mongo with homebrew below, or from [http://www.mongodb.org/downloads](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)

    brew install mongodb

Install dependencies

	npm install

Start mongo database

    mongod

Preview your app with

    npm preview

Start app with

    npm production

### Todo:

- add db config, models and odm thingy
- add some css patterns from other projects
- make this a solid starting point for future projects!
